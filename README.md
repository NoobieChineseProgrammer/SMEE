- Add a package.json file `touch packages/new-package/package.json`
- In the package.json file add `"name": "@smee/new-package"`
- In the package.json file add `"version":"1.0.0"`
- To use the package inside another package add the dependency `"@smee/new-package": "1.0.0"`
- Import in the file you want to use from the new package `import newpackage from '@smee/new-package`
- If there are any issues delete `node_modules` and the `lock` files in the repo.
- Profit.
